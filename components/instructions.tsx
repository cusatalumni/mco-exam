                        To ensure a fair and valuable experience, there are limits on exam attempts:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       During the test, you can navigate with "Next" and "Previous" buttons. If you try to skip a question, a warning will appear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you submit an exam with unanswered questions, you will be warned. If you proceed, they will be marked as incorrect. This ensures you don't submit an incomplete test by accident.
